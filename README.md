## Motivation
This virtual-pet game was developed to support a research study of "How does people's perception of virtual-pets affect their ability to form attachments and get movtivated to interact with them". Virtual-pet is a useful research topic as helping people get motivated to interact with them and form attachments with them can help with providing users with benefits such as mental health, education, and relaxation and companionship.

## Technology
We are using Unity-Engine version 2022.3.8f1 as the current latest LTS version.
We are using Firestore Database to persist interaction data. One using this repository should be able to connect up their own Firebase account to the game.
