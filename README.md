## Motivation
This virtual-pet game was developed to support a research study of "How does people's perception of virtual-pets affect their ability to form attachments and get movtivated to interact with them". Such a goal was sought after as an extension of findings on the Uncanny Valley: a theory stating that the human likeness of a virtual character and perception of familiarity from the audience are positively correlated, with the exception of a drastic dip of familiarity just before full realism as shown in Fig 1.<br /><br />

Additionally, the focus was shifted from measuring familiarity to affection and user attachments to align better with common research directions in the sub-domain of virtual pets.<br /><br />
We believe our research can help encourage a wider usage of virtual pets by helping people get motivated to interact with them and form attachments with them, providing users with benefits such as mental health, education, and relaxation and companionship.
